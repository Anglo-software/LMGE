# LMGE (Lorentzian Manifold Geodesic Engine)

This program is a physics engine which is capable of calculating the paths of particles in curved space-time, such as near a dense body like a black hole. It is written in Python, C++, and CUDA to gain both high performance through GPU parallelization and use of common Python libraries like NumPy and MatPlotLib for ease of programming.
